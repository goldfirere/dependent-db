Dependent DB
------------

This is the code that accompanies Richard Eisenberg's talk from
the winter of 2015 and dissertation.
It requires GHC 8.0. It is a proof-of-concept
that a database schema can be inferred, using type inference, from
a program that accesses the database. It is not meant as a serious
implementation of anything.
